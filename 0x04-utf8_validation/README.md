# 0x04-utf8_validation

## Description 
UTF-8 is a dominant encoding for world wide web. It is 8-bit and has backward copatibility. 

It was created after ASCII. 

The project writes a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

    * Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
    * Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
    * A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
    * The data set can contain multiple characters
    * The data will be represented by a list of integers
    Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
